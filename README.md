# A Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Approach for Object Classification in Very High-Resolution Satellite Images
This repository contains the code for the following publication "A Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Approach for Object Classification in Very High-Resolution Satellite Images". Link: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/18/4631
 
# Brief Description
This repository is of the approach designed to encrypt High-resolution remote sensing images. It uses a hybrid approach to encrypt the object in remote sensing images. The hybrid PPDL approach utilizes the combination of Partially homomorphic encryption and Somewhat homomorphic encryption from the generated keys. The benefit of this approach is to ensure the privacy of the useful information in the image.

# Model Detail
This model has three steps that are shown below:
